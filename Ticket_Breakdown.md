# Ticket Breakdown

We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

  

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables

- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each

- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

  

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

  

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**

  
  

Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".

  
  

You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

  

## Your Breakdown Here

### Ticket One: Full test coverage without breaking functionality. 
Assuming existing functionality is doing things correctly, there are some missing edge cases where more tests need to be performed. A default one is given for example where deterministicPartitionKey always returns zero, but it is missing other cases like, when an event has partition keys, when we make keys with event data or when keys are not in string type. There is also a corner case to check when we are making keys with partition keys and the string size is invalid. Please cover all of the cases in your test code to check all functionality is working fine. -- Time estimation: One hour

  

### Ticket Two  Refactoring old code base 
The code may be refactored with less lines of codes and increase readability. Some checking may appear redundant and unnecessary. This function should return a key generated by the event's partition key or the event itself when the event is present, when the default default key can be returned, By keeping this core logic consistent your code can be refactored to any extent but the test code should not break. Time Estimation: One Hour
